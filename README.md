- We will be using the MeaningCloud Sentiment Analysis API for this project.
# What We Can Benfit And Learn From This Project:
-Setting up Webpack
-Sass styles
-Webpack Loaders and Plugins
-Creating layouts and page design
-Service workers
-Using APIs and creating requests to external URLs.
# Setup the project : 
- CD project directory
$ npm install
- use the API_Key to activate the api
-To Run in Development mode :
$ npm run build-dev
- To Run in production mode :
$ npm run build-prod && npm start.
- Run in Test Mode : 
$ npm run test
# walkthrough : 
- Installed all the require packages .
- Modified the webpack config files to make the both invironments the dev and prod modes .
- made the env file to include the api key inside .
- made the api server to serve the app on port 8081 for production and port 8080 for development and setup fetch invironment for the get and post routes .
- redesigned the index file to match the new api and make it dynamically get the api data to update the UI of the page .
- converted the css style sheet to sass style cheet and minamize it by loaders of the webpack also made new design to the UI .

* Tests:       4 passed, 4 total .
- made a checkurl function thanks to stackoverflow to check the valid url input by the user.
